# What are the appropriate scenarios for employing queuing systems and streaming systems?

Queuing systems and streaming systems are used in different scenarios and serve different purposes. Here are some guidelines on when to use each one:

### Queuing Systems:

    When you have a set of tasks that need to be completed in a specific order and processed sequentially, a queuing system can be useful. For example, if you have a batch of jobs to be run on a cluster of servers, a queuing system can manage the order and distribution of the jobs to the servers.
    When you have intermittent traffic with high peaks, queuing systems can help you to handle these peaks by buffering the incoming requests and distributing them at a sustainable rate. For example, if you have a website that experiences sudden spikes in traffic, a queuing system can help you to manage the load and prevent your servers from becoming overloaded.

### Streaming Systems:

    When you need to process data in real-time and produce continuous output, a streaming system can be useful. For example, if you want to process data from IoT sensors or social media feeds and produce real-time insights, a streaming system can help you to do this efficiently.
    When you have a large amount of data that is too big to fit into memory, a streaming system can help you to process the data in a scalable and distributed manner. For example, if you have a dataset that is too large to fit into RAM, you can use a streaming system to process the data in chunks and produce intermediate results.

In summary, queuing systems are best used when you need to manage a set of tasks in a specific order, while streaming systems are best used when you need to process data in real-time or handle large amounts of data in a scalable and distributed manner.
